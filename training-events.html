    Events play a huge part in your success at AmeriSHOWZ, and nothing is more important than going to our company&rsquo;s major conventions. Regardless of your tight financial situation, you must find a way to come up with the money and go.<p></p>Just to let you know how important it is to go&hellip;<p></p>I have a policy not to work with anyone in my downline that skips out on the major AmeriSHOWZ conventions. Now you may think that is too strict and rigid, but I have valid reason why. In almost 10 years in AmeriSHOWZ, I have NEVER met anyone that earns over $4,000 USD/month that has NOT gone to AmeriSHOWZ convention.<p></p>Everyone who is earning goes, and everyone who does not go, fails to achieve their goals. So if you are skipping out, that means you are not going to succeed. And if you are not going to succeed, then there is no point for me to waste your time or my time to train you. You might as well just give up early and make it easy for both of us!<p></p>So if you want to make money in MLM, you must GO!
